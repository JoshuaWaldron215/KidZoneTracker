Goal:
Develop a digital solution to manage KidZone occupancy in real-time, notify parents when it is full, and indicate if additional rooms are open.

1. Problem Statement
Parents arrive at the YMCA expecting to drop their kids off at KidZone, but it is already full.
Parents get frustrated due to the lack of prior notification.
There is no real-time occupancy tracking or way to notify parents when space opens up.
Two rooms are available on certain days, but parents don’t always know when or where.
2. Proposed Solution
A real-time occupancy tracking system that counts the number of children in each KidZone room.
Parent notifications via email, text, or a YMCA mobile app when a room is full or available.
A web-based dashboard for staff and parents to check live capacity.
3. Key Features
A. Live Occupancy Tracking
Staff can input/check the number of kids currently in each KidZone room.
Automatic updates every few minutes.
Visual representation (e.g., color-coded status: Green = Available, Yellow = Near Capacity, Red = Full).
B. Notifications System
Parents can opt-in for SMS/email alerts.
Notifications are triggered when:
A room reaches max capacity.
A space becomes available.
A second room is opened.
C. Web/Mobile Dashboard
Displays current capacity of KidZone rooms.
Accessible via YMCA’s website or a mobile app.
Allows staff to update occupancy numbers.
4. Technology Stack
Component	Possible Tech Options
Frontend (Web/App)	React.js, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, Bootstrap
Backend	Node.js, Express.js, Firebase, or MySQL
Database	Firebase Realtime DB, MongoDB, or MySQL
Notification System	Twilio (for SMS), SendGrid (for email), Firebase Push Notifications
Authentication (if needed)	Firebase Auth, OAuth
5. Implementation Plan
Phase 1: Research & Planning
Gather input from KidZone staff about pain points.
Identify how YMCA staff currently track KidZone occupancy.
Check if YMCA has an existing mobile app to integrate with.
Phase 2: Prototype Development
Build a simple web interface for staff to log the number of kids in KidZone.
Create a database to store capacity data.
Develop a notification system (manual test with SMS/email alerts).
Phase 3: Testing & Feedback
Run tests during busy hours to evaluate effectiveness.
Gather feedback from staff and parents.
Adjust notification frequency and occupancy tracking if needed.
Phase 4: Full Deployment
Optimize the interface for mobile and desktop use.
